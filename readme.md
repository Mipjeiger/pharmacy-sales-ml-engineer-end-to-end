# 🧪💊 Pharmacy Machine Learning Engineer – End-to-End Workflow

This repository demonstrates a **production-ready, end-to-end Machine Learning workflow** for pharmacy analytics, covering data ingestion, feature engineering, model training, orchestration, monitoring, and alerting.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is designed using **modern ML engineering best practices**, ensuring scalability, reproducibility, and observability across the entire pipeline.

---

## 🔄 End-to-End Workflow Explanation

### 📥 1. Data Sources & Ingestion
Raw pharmacy data (e.g. sales, transactions, pricing) is collected from:
- 📄 CSV files  
- 🔄 Upstream operational systems  

Data ingestion is handled using **Kafka**, enabling both **batch** and **real-time streaming** ingestion.

---

### 🗄️ 2. PostgreSQL – Source of Truth
All ingested data is stored in **PostgreSQL**, which acts as the **single source of truth**:
- Raw data persistence  
- Data validation  
- Historical consistency  

---

### 🧩 3. Feature Engineering (SQL)
Using **SQL transformations**, raw data is converted into **ML-ready feature tables**, such as:
- Aggregated sales metrics  
- Price statistics  
- Time-based features  

These feature tables are optimized for training and reproducibility.

---

### 🛠️ 4. Orchestration with Airflow
**Apache Airflow** orchestrates the entire pipeline through DAGs that manage:
- ⏰ Scheduled data ingestion  
- 🔁 Feature table generation  
- 🚀 Model training triggers  
- 🔗 Task dependencies  

Kafka events can also act as **real-time triggers** for Airflow DAG execution.

---

### 🤖 5. Model Training (`train.py`)
Once features are available, Airflow triggers the **`train.py`** script:
- Loads features from PostgreSQL  
- Trains the machine learning model  
- Evaluates performance metrics  

This stage represents the **core ML engineering logic**.

---

### 📊 6. Experiment Tracking & Model Registry (MLflow)
All experiments are logged to **MLflow**, including:
- 📈 Metrics  
- ⚙️ Hyperparameters  
- 📦 Model artifacts  

MLflow also manages **model versioning**, ensuring full traceability and reproducibility.

---

### 🐳 7. Containerization (Docker)
The pipeline runs inside **Docker containers**, providing:
- Environment consistency  
- Reproducible training runs  
- Easier deployment across environments  

---

### 📡 8. Monitoring & Observability
System and pipeline health are monitored using **Grafana**, enabling:
- 📊 Resource monitoring  
- 🔍 Pipeline observability  
- 🚨 Early issue detection  

---

### 🔔 9. Notifications & Alerts (Slack)
**Slack alerts** notify stakeholders in real time about:
- ✅ Successful pipeline runs  
- ❌ Airflow DAG failures  
- 🧠 Model training completion  

---
